One Saturday morning she was digging in the garden when she found an old box in the ground. She took it in her hands and looked at it carefully. It was a yellow, old wooden box. She was very happy because she thought she found a treasure. She took the box into the kitchen and cleaned it with some paper. Then, she took a knife and tried to open it but it was really hard. She tried again until she opened it. In the box were some old pictures of her mother when she was a little girl. Mary wasn't Sad. Those pictures were a real treasure for her!",

        "title": "Where Does Chocolate Come From?",
        "passage": "Chocolate that we eat starts with cacao trees, also called cocoa trees. Cacao trees grow in a warm climate like Central and South America, Africa or parts of Asia. This tree produces a seed pod and cocoa beans are the seeds inside the pod. Cocoa beans eventually become chocolate. At the chocolate factory, the beans are cleaned and then they are roasted for up to 2 hours in large rotating drums. The cocoa beans tumble in these drums like clothes in a clothes dryer. As they dry, the beans turn to a rich brown color. After roasting, the shell of the cocoa bean is removed and the inside of the cocoa beans are then ground by heavy steel plates. This grinding process forms a chocolate liquid. When chocolate liquid is molded and cooled, the product is called unsweetened or bitter chocolate. Sometimes the chocolate liquid is made into dry cocoa powder. When cocoa is made, oil from the cocoa bean is pressed out and is known as cocoa butter. Add sugar, cocoa butter, and vanilla flavoring to unsweetened chocolate and you have a chocolate candy. If you also add milk, the product is milk chocolate. Next the milk chocolate mixture goes through heating and cooling cycles before being molded. Finally it is molded into milk chocolate candy bars or it is made into ten-pound blocks of chocolate that are sold to other candy bar manufacturers.",

Part of Lieber’s childhood took place during the Great Depression, and Stan’s family, which included a younger brother named Larry, struggled to make ends meet. Stan got a job as an office assistant for Timely Comics when he was just 17 years old. By the early 1940s, he had worked himself up to the position of Interim Editor. Around the same time, Lee also served in the Army during World War II. He served in the U.S. as a writer and illustrator. By the early 1960s, Timely Comics had changed its name to Marvel Comics, and they were in competition with D.C. Comics, whose Justice League of America had become famous. Lee’s boss asked him to create a rival series for Marvel Comics. Lee was up for the challenge, but he wanted his superheroes to be different. Together with the artist Jack Kirby, Lee co-created The Fantastic Four. More now-famous Marvel characters followed including the Hulk, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, Daredevil, and the X-Men. According to Stan Lee, “a really great comic-book story is every bit as creative and important as a great story done in any other form of the media.”",
