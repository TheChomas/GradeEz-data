    "passage": "Mary had a beautiful garden with roses, tulips and carnations. She liked to work in her garden at the weekend. One Saturday morning she was digging in the garden when she found an old box in the ground. She took it in her hands and looked at it carefully. It was a yellow, old wooden box. She was very happy because she thought she found a treasure. She took the box into the kitchen and cleaned it with some paper. Then, she took a knife and tried to open it but it was really hard. She tried again until she opened it. In the box were some old pictures of her mother when she was a little girl. Mary wasn't Sad. Those pictures were a real treasure for her!",
